                <p>
                    The goals of Scherma Nova Studiorum are based in the ideas of collaborative learning, and mutual aid and support. These can encompass a wide range of learning approaches and projects, including:

                    <li>Taking a class, or asking someone else to teach you a thing</li>
                    <li>Use of group learning materials</li>

                <h2>Historical Inspiration</h2>
                <p>
                    Scherma Nova Studiorum is modeled on the student guilds in 11th century Bologna, which eventually led to the formation of the first university. The guilds were formed for mutual aid and protection, by foreign students who had traveled to Bologna to study Roman law. They also functioned as a sort of union, in that they were able to engage in collective bargaining with the city to secure better treatment, and with groups of scholars that they hired to instruct them in various subjects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of our group, we extrapolate from that idea, that a group of students may have also hired instructors to teach them fencing and self defense. Some of the Bolognese school of fencing masters were in fact also instructors at the university. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideas from the Bologna model that we find most relatable are the secular focus (most education around this time in Europe was religious in nature) and the way it centers the students, rather than the instructors, as our group aims to be knowledge-seeking, rather than knowledge-imparting. 
                </p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>
                To further our goals of making everyone feel safe and supported in their training and learning, we require our members and anyone participating in group sponsered activities to abide by the following code of conduct:
            </p>
            <h3>Expectations of Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We are creating an intentionally inclusive space - making marginalized people feel welcome is a priority
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask for, learn, and use people’s pronouns</li>
                        <li>Try to avoid unnecessarily gendered language</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We as students are encouraged to experiment with theories and techniques. This means:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reducing the social cost of failure by modelling it and emphasizing that the ideal success rate is 75% not 100%</li>
                        <li>Ideas and discussion are valued by all contributors, regardless of experience level.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consent culture
                    <ul>
                        <li>Physical - ask before making a physical correction</li>
                        <li>Mental - ask before giving feedback, advice or teaching</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Encourage communication
                    <ul>
                        <li>When working with someone, have a conversation first about expectations, goals and boundaries</li>
                        <li>Respect agreed-upon boundaries once they are negotiated</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Physical safety
                    <ul>
                        <li>Observe agreed-upon practices for physical safety and respect the safety rules created by the practice space</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Opt-in process - learning is a dialog
                    <ul>
                        <li>Study works best with mutual participation and student ownership of study</li>
                        <li>Consent is also integral to the learning process</li>
                        <li>Students opt into training modes, but they are in charge of their own learning</li>                          
                        <li>Both giving and receiving feedback are opt-in on an interaction to interaction basis</li>
                        <li>Guild members may withdraw consent for further feedback at any time</li>
                        <li>The nature of study means that requests for support or training participation may also require student to put in outside time and effort</li>
                        <li>Unless explicitly stated in a particular self contained situation, no one is participating in guild activities as a teacher or a coach. Everyone is here to learn.</li>   
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
